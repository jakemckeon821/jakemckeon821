Hello everyone and welcome! My name is Jake McKeon and I am a Suny Oneonta alumnus with a bachelors degree specializing in Applied Science Computer Science. I am excited to see where my career takes me and what I will be doing with it!<br><br>
I have always had a love for computers internally and externally, and nothing would be better than to continute working around them. Working with computers not only allows me to explore my interests but also provides a platform to solve real-world problems creatively. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others, share knowledge, and innovate solutions that can make a significant impact. Whether it's developing a new web application or optimizing existing systems, I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm to contribute meaningfully to any team or project.<br><br>
